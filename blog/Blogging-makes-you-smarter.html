              <p>There are all kinds of business reasons  why blogging as an entrepreneur is wise . You score higher in Google, can better explain where your expertise lies and therefore get more customers and turnover. In addition, there is another good reason to blog: <b></b>it makes you smarter .</b></p>
				      <p>After all, there is a big difference between having knowledge and sharing knowledge. The moment you decide to share your knowledge with others, you are forced to think extra carefully about it. You know - to name a few - a few useful tips for paying less tax, why milk is unhealthy, what is the best way to raise children or how to get organizations to work together better.</p>
              <p>But have you said everything on this subject? Can't you think of more tips or reasons than the few you know? And does it answer all the questions of your target group? Do they know everything about this subject now? Couldn't you help them even further?<br>That's when your knowledge will grow.</p>
              <p>Now that you are going to put your advice on paper, you cannot be satisfied with half the story. You will have to consider whether there might not be a fifth advantage in addition to those four advantages. And if your reader comes up with a question that you have not considered before, you will have to look into it further. After all, you present yourself as an expert, so you cannot leave too many questions open.</p>
            <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">You Learn to Discover Connections</h4>
					    <p>You have to think about how to convey it clearly, in a good structure . This way you will discover patterns sooner, see connections, delete nonsensical things and notice what is most important in your story</p>
				  <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">And You Become More Communicative</h4>					    
					    <p> All these new insights are fantastic topics to blog about. This is how you end up in an upward spiral. You started blogging because you were an expert, but blogging makes you more of an expert , which gives you more to blog about. So even if you don't immediately score higher in Google and you don't immediately double your turnover, it is still valuable to start blogging and keep blogging. It really makes you smarter. And then those customers ultimately come faster.
				  <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">You get ideas about your company</h4>	
					    <p>By formulating your knowledge, you will also look at your business more closely and come up with new ideas and insights. Can't you take a closer look at that one area of ​​interest? Wouldn't you look into that a little more now that you hear so many questions about it? Shouldn't you start a new service on that subject?</p>
				   <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">And you get new blog topics</h4>	
					<p>All these new insights are fantastic topics to blog about. This is how you end up in an upward spiral. You started blogging because you were an expert, but blogging makes you more of an expert , which gives you more to blog about. So even if you don't immediately score higher in Google and you don't immediately double your turnover, it is still valuable to start blogging and keep blogging. It really makes you smarter.
